The '''pCO<sub>2</sub>''', '''PCO<sub>2</sub>''', <math chem>p_\ce{CO2}</math>or <math chem>P_\ce{CO2}</math> is the [[partial pressure]] of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), often used in reference to [[blood]] but also used in oceanography to describe the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean and in life support systems engineering and underwater diving to describe the partial pressure in a breathing gas. Usually, the [[arterial blood]] is the relevant context; the symbol for <math chem>P_\ce{CO2}</math> in arterial blood is <math chem>P_{a_\ce{CO2}}</math>. Measurement of <math chem>P_{a_\ce{CO2}}</math> in the [[systemic circulation]] indicates the effectiveness of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] at the lungs' [[pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], given the [[diffusing capacity]] of the gas. It is a good indicator of respiratory function and the closely related factor of [[acidâ€“base homeostasis]], reflecting the amount of acid in the blood (without lactic acid).
